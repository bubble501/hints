Today i am going to write about the infrastructural point of view.

It also has to do with the following upcoming issue mentioned here:
https://github.com/paritytech/parity/issues/7531

It seems that the ehereum network structures do not grow as fast, as most of us wished in the early days of 2018-
where we had over 24.000 active nodes within the ethereum network and the balances of the national overview began to swap.

While us was the leading nation driving any kind of ethereum node, it seemed to me as if the chinese people,
although limited by their admininstration to join icos they were able to manage to take part within the network
whith "operating" nodes for interaction with the ethereum main-chain.

From that day on, the splay of the widest spread changed until today concerning, 
that chinese nodes play a more important role than before, 
whereas it means also that the russion federation has gained more reliance from their administration-
running mining-farms as well as nodes-
and next nation to be mentioned with a increasing count of ethereum nodes-
which exactly matches with my expectations- 
canada is "th"e coming up krypto-oriented nation in 2018-
