today i would to clear,

what an airdrop is.

an airdrop is an unwanted and ununsolicited donation to your wallet.

as some of them look funny it could be nice to keep the issued tokens.

those tokens get emitted to accounts within the ethereum universe with some "ether" on
awaiting that users who have ethers, would also tend to spend and get used to the "othercoin"
and probably on productive use would "rebuy" such coins.

airdrops=unwanted token emission to your wallet/account-

no worry, can keep them, leave them, or just transfer all of them onto my account, 
i resend you the transfer fee in ether.

is my account-

drop everything there you do not like within your wallet-
as you can transfer it, 
push it there.
keep an eye on the transaction and notify me about it.
