as comments or other notes are concerned-
i did not drop this list to stress somebody.
as anyone feels that some link should be erase or whatever- contact me, i am human,
understanding sorts of privacy ideas.
i am contactable within gitter directly as needed.
feel free to do so- so many questions still there-
another day another question to be answered.
